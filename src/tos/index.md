Unless you are entitled to a refund under these terms and conditions or as required by applicable law (which cannot be excluded by us), fees paid in advance will not be refunded.

Non-Business Use:  If you are using Paid Services as a consumer (as opposed to a business) and on a subscription basis, you may have a legal right to cancel your purchase of the Paid Services or upgrade to a different Package as provided under applicable local law and receive a refund. If you wish to exercise this legal right, you must notify us of your decision to cancel the initial purchase or upgrade by a clear statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail) within 14 days (or such longer period as provided under applicable local law) from the date of requesting the purchase of the Paid Services Package upgrade ("**Cancellation Period**"). We will reimburse you in accordance with the requirements of the applicable local law and using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless agreed otherwise. We reserve the right to deduct an amount which is in proportion to those services that have been performed up until the point you communicate cancellation to us, in comparison to the full coverage of the relevant upgrade fee paid. In any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.

This cancellation right is only available in respect of your first upgrade to each of the Packages. By creating a Paid Services account and requesting an upgrade to a Package (as applicable) you are requesting immediate performance of this Agreement.
