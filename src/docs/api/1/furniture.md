# Furniture

Furniture API calls give you access to a broad [furniture library](https://furniture.3d.io) powered by [Archilogic](https://spaces.archilogic.com/explore).

Namespace: `io3d.furniture`

## search

Searches the library using a text query. Will return a promise which resolves with a list of [furniture objects](#furniture-data-structure) (without geometry data).

### Example

Get a list of max 50 furniture objects related to `wood` and `chair`:
```javascript
  io3d.furniture.search('Wood Chair', { limit: 50 }).then(console.log)
```

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | String | Yes | An string specifying search options (see below) or `null` to return random furniture pieces. |
| `options` | Object | No | |
| `options.limit` | Number | No | How many results will be returned at most. |

<!--
The `searchQuery` object looks like this with all fields being optional:

| Field name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `query` | A text that will be fuzzily matched against the name, description, tags and manufacturer of the product |
| `lengthMin` | Minimum length of the product in centimeters |
| `lengthMax` | Maximum length of the product in centimeters |
| `widthMin` | Minimum width of the product in centimeters |
| `widthMax` | Maximum width of the product in centimeters |
| `heightMin` | Minimum height of the product in centimeters |
| `heightMax` | Maximum height of the product in centimeters |
-->


## get

Gets a single furniture piece including its geometry and [metadata](https://3d.io/docs/api/1/furniture.html#furniture-metadata).

### Example

The following snippet reads a single piece of furniture using a specific furniture ID:

```javascript
  io3d.furniture.get('943357e8-911f-4bb5-8b89-8281385ef08f').then(console.log)
```

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `furnitureId` | String | Yes | The ID of the furniture piece to retrieve. Obtain furnitureIds from the furniture library: at https://furniture.3d.io |

## getInfo

Gets [metadata information](https://3d.io/docs/api/1/furniture.html#furniture-metadata) for a single furniture piece. This method skip the loading geometry and therefore uses less bandwith than `io3d.furniture.get`.

```javascript
  io3d.furniture.getInfo('943357e8-911f-4bb5-8b89-8281385ef08f').then(console.log)
```

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `furnitureId` | String | Yes | The ID of the furniture piece to retrieve. Obtain furnitureIds from the furniture library: at https://furniture.3d.io | 

### Example

The following snippet reads the metadata of a single piece of furniture using a specific furniture ID:

```javascript
  io3d.furniture.getInfo('943357e8-911f-4bb5-8b89-8281385ef08f').then(console.log)
```

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `furnitureId` | String | Yes | The ID of the furniture piece to retrieve. Obtain furnitureIds from the furniture library: at https://furniture.3d.io |


## Furniture Metadata

Exemplary metadata structure included in `io3d.furniture.search`, `io3d.furniture.get` and `io3d.furniture.getInfo`.
